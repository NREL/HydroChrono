# CMake Build Configuration Basics for HydroChrono

This guide explains how CMake handles build configurations across platforms, and how to correctly configure and build HydroChrono to avoid common issues.

## Overview

HydroChrono uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system. CMake generates native build files (like Makefiles or Visual Studio projects) that compile your source code. One key part of this process is choosing a **build configuration**, which determines things like optimization level, debug symbol inclusion, and compatibility with dependencies.

## What Are CMake Generators?

A **generator** is the type of build system CMake creates. Common examples:

- **Unix Makefiles** (Linux/macOS)
- **Ninja** (cross-platform)
- **Visual Studio** (Windows)
- **Xcode** (macOS)

CMake picks a default generator based on your platform, but you can override it using `-G` (e.g., `-G Ninja`).

## Single-Config vs. Multi-Config Generators

CMake generators fall into two categories:

| Type              | Examples             | When You Choose Build Type                           | Typical Platforms |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Single-Config** | Makefiles, Ninja     | At **configure time** using `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=...` | Linux, macOS      |
| **Multi-Config**  | Visual Studio, Xcode | At **build time** using `--config ...`               | Windows, macOS    |

### üßπ What's the difference?

- **Single-config generators** create a build setup for *one* build type (like `Release` or `Debug`) at a time. If you want to switch types, you need to reconfigure the build or use a separate build directory.

  > ‚úÖ Pro: Simple, fast\
  > ‚ùå Con: Not flexible ‚Äî can't build both Debug and Release without reconfiguring

- **Multi-config generators** support *multiple* build types in a single configuration. You choose which type to build at build time with `--config`.

  > ‚úÖ Pro: Flexible ‚Äî build Debug and Release from the same configuration\
  > ‚ùå Con: Only available with certain IDEs like Visual Studio and Xcode

### Single-Config Example (Linux/macOS)

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

To switch to Debug:

```bash
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build .
```

### Multi-Config Example (Windows with Visual Studio)

```powershell
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è On Windows with Visual Studio, `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is ignored.

## Common Build Types

| Type             | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Debug`          | No optimizations, full debug symbols  |
| `Release`        | Full optimizations, no debug symbols  |
| `RelWithDebInfo` | Optimized, but includes debug symbols |
| `MinSizeRel`     | Optimized for smallest binary size    |

Choose the **same build type** for both HydroChrono and Project Chrono to avoid linker errors or runtime issues.

## Why Build Type Consistency Matters

Mismatching build types (e.g., HydroChrono in `Release` but Chrono in `RelWithDebInfo`) can lead to:

- Linker errors (e.g., unresolved symbols)
- ODR (One Definition Rule) violations
- Runtime crashes or inconsistent behavior

Always match the build type of your dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

- üîç Not sure what build type Chrono was built with? Check `CMakeCache.txt` in its build directory.
- üßπ Switching build types? Delete your build directory and reconfigure (`rm -rf build/`).

## Best Practices

- Always explicitly specify your build type.
- Use consistent build types across all dependencies.
- Prefer out-of-source builds (`mkdir build && cd build`) to keep files clean.
- Document your build settings to avoid confusion later.

By understanding how CMake generators and build types work, you can avoid many common pitfalls when building and working with HydroChrono and its dependencies.
