Welcome to HydroChrono
======================

Introduction
------------

HydroChrono is designed for the numerical simulation of hydrodynamic bodies - specifically for offshore renewable energy systems. Developed to work seamlessly with the Project Chrono physics engine, it provides users and developers with powerful tools to simulate offshore systems.

.. note::
   **Development Notice:** HydroChrono is in early development, and users may encounter some challenges. However, we are keenly interested in community contributions and collaborations. We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm in joining us on this journey!
