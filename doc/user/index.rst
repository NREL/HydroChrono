Introduction
------------

HydroChrono is purpose-built for the numerical simulation of hydrodynamic bodies in the time-domain, with a particular focus on offshore renewable energy systems. It integrates seamlessly with the Project Chrono physics engine, offering users powerful tools for simulating offshore systems. HydroChrono is capable of modeling multibody floating systems and with complete access to Chrono's capabilities, users can model intricate subsystems, and use the finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM) tools available in Chrono.
