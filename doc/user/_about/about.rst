Project History
---------------


Since 2023, HydroChrono has been developed jointly by NREL and TotalEnergies to simulate offshore renewable energy systems (namely wave energy converters, WECs, and floating offshore wind turbines, FOWTs).

HydroChrono began as an effort to overcome some limitations in the WEC modeling field (e.g. added mass, speed, licensing, modeling capabilities).

By using Project Chrono, we ultimately aim to create a multifidelity simulation framework, where system models can be easily simualted with either potential flow hydrodynamics or high fidelity methods such as CFD and SPH.

FAQs
----

- FAQ 1: Is HydroChrono open-source?

  - HydroChrono is developed under the permissive open-source license, Apache 2.0.

- FAQ 2: What programming languages does HydroChrono support?

  - HydroChrono is developed in C++ and interacts with Project Chrono via the Chrono C++ API.

- FAQ 3: Will there be a HydroChrono Python package?

  - While a Python package for HydroChrono would offer a more user-friendly interface and facilitate interaction with PyChrono, the development of such a package is contingent upon future project funding.
