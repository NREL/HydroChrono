# Building HydroChrono with Project Chrono and HDF5 files

## Requirements
* Chrono installed and built in RelWithDebInfo mode (currently using dev branch see note below) (built with Irrlicht module) and Chrono dependencies (see [Chrono Install/Build Guide for details](https://api.projectchrono.org/tutorial_install_chrono.html) ). This includes items like
	* C++ Compiler (Visual Studio 2019 or newer required, 2019 recommended)
	* Eigen3 (3.3.0 or newer required, 3.4.0 recommended)
	* Irrlicht Engine (1.8.4)
	* CMake
	* GIT client

* Install H5Cpp header file from HDF5Group Note: Version 1.10.8 recommended, other versions may not work as intended. [Download Link](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Downloads) [Instructions](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Building+HDF5+with+CMake#BuildingHDF5withCMake-quickins) Note 2: This is why Visual Studio 2019 is recommended above, building HDF5 with newer versions of Visual Studio is not as clear. To clarify the HDF5Group setup/build instructions here is a short summary of the steps:
	1. Extract zip somewhere
	2. Go into `<path>\libraries\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8` which contains .bat files etc and open command line (SHIFT + right click, open powershell window on windows)
	3. Execute the batch file or shell script for your platform. For example, `ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS201964 -C RelWithDebInfo -V -O hdf5.log` 
	4. Config `RelWithDebInfo` is the recommended configuration to allow running in Release mode or a debug mode (RelWithDebInfo).
	5. Wait for it to configure everything and run all its tests, most should pass.
	6. Locate and uncompress built binary its name is `HDF5-N-<platform>.<zip or tar.gz>` it appears in 2 locations, unzip the one in the build folder!
	7. Navagate to `<path>\libraries\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8\build\HDF5-1.10.8-win64\HDF5-1.10.8-win64\share\cmake` or similar location to the cmake folder. Check that `hdf5-config.cmake` files are here.
	8. In general, to use HDF5 library users must first set the `HDF5_DIR` environment variable to the installed location of the CMake configuration files for HDF5. For example, on Windows the following path might be set:
		* `HDF5_DIR=C:\Users\USER\code\libraries\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8\CMake-hdf5-1.10.8\build\HDF5-1.10.8-win64\HDF5-1.10.8-win64\share\cmake`

* Recommended (For use with Python): Install and build PyChrono according to [instructions.](https://api.projectchrono.org/module_python_installation.html) Note, instructions for building PyChrono include installing SWIG to generate python files-this is used again to generate python from HydroChrono C++ code.

* (optional) Gnuplot [Gnuplot Home](http://www.gnuplot.info/) or other plotting software

## Building HydroChrono (and demos)
1. Install and build above requirements.
2. Now to build HydroChrono library: 
	1. Clone this project into a directory, and set up a build folder (i.e. clone project into HydroChrono directory and set up HydroChrono_build adjacent directory). 
	2. Just like when building Project Chrono, open CMake GUI specifying the location of the source files and built binaries for HydroChrono (HydroChrono and HydroChrono_build respectively). Configure and generate the solution, specifying `Chrono_DIR` as Chrono Build location (`../chrono_build/cmake`) and HDF5_DIR as (`../CMake-hdf5-1.10.8/CMake-hdf5-1.10.8/build/HDF5-1.10.8-win64/HDF5-1.10.8-win64/share/cmake` or similar path to find the cmake file at the end of this path). Note: version 1.10.8 of HDF5 works best with Visual Studio 2019.
	3. Navigate to the build folder and open the solution in Visual Studio. Build the solution for HydroChrono in RelWithDebInfo mode (The `ALL_BUILD` project is the best for building and linking everything. It will build the library and all demos).
3. From Project Chrono build directory copy `chrono_build/bin/data` file into `HydroChrono_build/demos/data` for shaders and logos
4. Navigate to `chrono_build/bin/RelWithDebInfo` folder and copy all .dll and .pdb files (not for demos) and paste them into `HydroChrono_build/demos/RelWithDebInfo` file. List of all files to copy:
	* ChronoEngine.dll
	* ChronoEngine.pdb
	* ChronoEngine_irrlicht.dll
	* ChronoEngine_irrlicht.pdb
	* ChronoEngine_postprocess.dll
	* ChronoEngine_postprocess.pdb
	* Irrlicht.dll (no pdb for Irrlicht)
	* and any other chrono module ChronoEngine_moduleName.dll and ChronoEngine_moduleName.pdb
5. Navigate to `HydroChrono_build/demos/RelWithDebInfo` and run executables. You may need to set up some output files to catch output/debug data. Optionally copy plot files into results files and generate plots. (TODO: have cmake copy these over automatically)

## Files
* src - contains source code for HydroChrono library
	* hydro_forces.cpp
		* implementation files for hydro forces initialized through H5 files
* include - contains header files for HydroChrono library
	* hydro_forces.h
		* header  files for hydro forces initialized through H5 files
* demos - contains information for various demos
	* demos/rm3 - contains required files for rm3 demos (decay test and regular wave test)
		* rm3_decay.cpp and rm3_reg_waves.cpp - demos showing rm3 decay and regular wave test respectively
		* demos/rm3/geometry - .obj files defining verticies on rm3 objects
		* demos/rm3/hydroData - contains rm3.h5 file
		* demos/rm3/postprocessing - contains .plt plotting files and WEC-Sim comparison data for plots. Copy these into results folder to plot demo outputs
	* demos/sphere - contains required files for sphere demos (decay test and regular wave test)
		* sphere_decay.cpp and sphere_reg_waves.cpp - demos showing sphere decay and regular wave test respectively
		* demos/sphere/geometry - .obj files defining verticies on sphere object
		* demos/sphere/hydroData - contains sphere.h5 file
		* demos/sphere/postprocessing - contains .plt and .py plotting files and WEC-Sim comparison data for plots. Copy these into results folder to plot demo outputs
